# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

##Overview

We have been tasking with doing an analytical review to try and show why the new MechaCar is suffering from production troubles. The desire goal of the project is this:
  * discover which variables determine the cars MPG's
  * summarize the stats on the PSI of the suspension coils
  * use the data to determine if the statistics are different across the lots
  * come up with a study to compare the performance to vehicles from other automakers.
